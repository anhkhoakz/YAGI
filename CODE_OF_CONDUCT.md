# Code of Conduct for Contributor Covenant

 ## Our Promise

 Regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, we, as members, contributors, and leaders, promise to ensure that everyone can participate in our community without experiencing harassment.

 We promise to behave and communicate in a way that promotes a friendly, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

 ## Our Criteria

 The following are some instances of conduct that enhances the atmosphere in our community:

 Exhibiting compassion and understanding for others
 Respecting the thoughts, perspectives, and experiences of others
 Providing and politely taking constructive criticism, taking ownership of our errors, expressing regret to those impacted, and growing from the experience
 Considering what is best for the community as a whole, not just for each of us individually

 Unacceptable conduct examples include:

 Sexualized language or images, sexual advances or attention of any type, trolling, offensive or disparaging remarks, and political or personal assaults
 Harassment in public or private
 Publicly disclosing someone else's personal information, such an email address or physical address, without that person's express consent; engaging in other behavior that might be deemed unacceptable in a professional environment

 ## Enforcement Obligations

 Community leaders are in charge of outlining and upholding our expectations for proper conduct, and they will respond to any behavior that they believe to be improper, dangerous, offensive, or damaging with appropriate and just remedial action.

 When necessary, community leaders will provide justifications for their moderation choices. They also have the authority and duty to delete, modify, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not adhere to this code of conduct.

 ## Scope

 This code of conduct is applicable in all public areas as well as when someone is formally speaking on behalf of the community.
 Using an official email address, commenting on social media, or serving as a designated representative at an event, whether online or off, are a few examples of how we represent our community.

 ## Implementation

 Community leaders in charge of enforcement can be contacted for reports of abusive, harassing, or otherwise inappropriate behavior.
 Every complaint will be quickly and equitably assessed and investigated.

 Every community leader has a duty to protect the confidentiality and safety of the person who reports an occurrence.

 ## Guidelines for Enforcement

 When deciding on the penalties for any behavior they believe violates this code of conduct, community leaders will refer to these Community Impact Guidelines:

 ### 1. Modification

 The use of improper language or other conduct that is considered unprofessional or undesirable in the community has an impact on the community.

 **Repercussion**: A written, confidential warning from local authorities outlining the specifics of the infraction and why the conduct was improper.  A public apology could be asked for.

 ### 2. Caution

 **Community Impact**: A transgression caused by a single event or sequence of events.

 **Consequence**: A warning followed by repercussions for persistent behavior.  No communication with the parties concerned for a predetermined amount of time, including unsolicited communication with personnel implementing the Code of Conduct.  Avoiding interactions in public areas and through outside platforms like social media is part of this.  A temporary or permanent ban could result from breaking these terms.

 #3. Temporary Prohibition

 **Community Impact**: Serious transgressions of community norms, such as persistently unacceptable conduct.

 **Repercussion**: A brief prohibition on engaging in any kind of public speech or interaction with the community for a predetermined amount of time.  During this time, there is no permitted public or private contact with the parties concerned, including uninvited contact with personnel implementing the Code of Conduct.
 There could be a permanent ban for breaking these terms.

 ### 4. Permanent Prohibition

 **Community Impact**: Exhibiting a habit of transgressing social norms, such as persistently inappropriate conduct, harassing someone, or acting aggressively or disparagingly against particular social classes.

 **Repercussion**: A lifelong prohibition on engaging in any kind of public communication within the neighborhood.

# YAGI: ANOTHER GITIGNORE

 A Visual Studio Code tool called YAGI facilitates the rapid creation and administration of.gitignore files for your projects.  It retrieves current templates for a variety of languages, tools, and environments using the [Toptal gitignore API](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore).



 ## Features

 Create a fresh.gitignore file using the templates you've chosen (e.g., node, macos, vscode, etc.)
 - Replace or add to an already-existing.gitignore file
 - Gets templates straight from the Toptal API, so you're always getting the most recent suggestions.

 ## Application

 1. Launch the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
 2. Type `Generate.gitignore` into the command bar.
 3. Choose one or more templates (such as `node`, `macos`, or `vscode`) from the list.
 4. If a.gitignore already exists, decide whether to append or override it.

 ## Conditions

 A working Internet connection (to retrieve templates from the API) and Visual Studio Code 1.74.0 or later

 ## Settings for Extensions

 No custom settings are added by this plugin.

 ## Recognized Problems

 In order to retrieve templates, an internet connection is necessary.
 It only functions in folders that are opened in Visual Studio Code as a workspace.

 ## Notes on Release

 ### 1.0.0-First release: Use the Toptal API to create and manage.gitignore files.
